<div id="interest">To add to @andy_magoon, in my case, I had a script tag that was supposed to serve up javascript, but because the request was redirected to an HTML page (its not important why it was redirected), which begins with <!DOCTYPE html>, which is not valid javascript, the browser returns the SyntaxError when it attempt to parse the HTML as JS. – david.barkhuizen Apr 4 '16 at 10:54

    @Thom The way to fix it is to make sure that the HTTP get returns the javascript file that you're looking for, and not unexpected HTML. – david.barkhuizen Apr 4 '16 at 11:07

    I got exactly this error because, as it turns out, the file path is incorrect and it can't find the file specified in script tag. – newman Jan 25 '17 at 1:57
    mine was 301 redirect issue itself. Fixed by appending / at the end of url. – Kishor Pawar Aug 2 '17 at 5:59
    I sometimes get this error when I try running an uncompleted project deployment on Heroku. – akolliy May 22 '20 at 17:49
    @david.barkhuizen I feel what you said is completely valid. But now how do i make the browser understand or send javascript file from the server – tencho Jul 9 '20 at 13:59 </div>
